- Which Iteration are you working in, and specifically where in that Iteration are you?
  Megan and I are finishing up Iteration 2.


- How have you been collaborating - driver/navigator, remote pairing, divide and conquer, etc? How has that been working out?
  We have done a little bit of everything so far. We did some driver navigator on the first day as well as remotely on Tuesday. We have also divided up some tasks. It has gone well although we have had a few merge conflicts but we are adapting to try to minimize those issues.

- How are you making sure that each of you has that 30 min - 1 hour of non-project study time a day?
  Dave-I spend some time each morning before leaving for Turing to review/preview lessons and get some extra practice in.

- What is one thing that each of you is really proud of so far?
  Dave-I am really proud of the clock function...it took a long time and I ran into several dead ends but ended up getting it to work.

- Make a Friday-Sunday plan. How will you collaborate together (keep weather in mind)? What goals do you have (around completion of an iteration, cleaning up code, slowing down to talk through what is done, etc). Make sure you are 100% clear on expectations for each other, regarding time commitments.
  Saturday--

- Looking back at your DTR, what's one thing you've done really well as a team? Is there anything you'd like to adjust in terms of how you are working together?


- Would you like your PM to review any of your code? We can't review the entire project, but we can look at a specific function, or look through the file if you have a specific question about organization or structure, etc. Please provide line numbers that correlate with your code on the master branch is applicable.
